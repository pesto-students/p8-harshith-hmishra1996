Starting from function createIncrement. The function have a count variable, 
and string which is assigned to message variable, and two functions which is increment and log. 

The createIncrement function returns an array containing two functions increment and log.

Thus, the createIncrement function is called and the result is de-structured into increment and log variable.

When createIncrement is called, it initializes count to 0 and message string is create with Count is 0.

Then, increment function is called 3 times. The increment function have access to count 
variable as it is in its lexical scope. Hence, each time the increment fucntion is called, 
the value of count is incremented by 1.

After 3 increment calls, the value of count is incremented 3.

Then, the log function is called. Once again, the log function also retains the access to 
message variable as it falls under its lexical scope. So, the log function prints/ logs into 
console - Count is 0.

Although the value of count is 3, the message was already assigned Count is 0 string when 
createIncrement was called.
